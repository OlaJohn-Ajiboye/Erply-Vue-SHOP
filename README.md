# Erply-Vue-SHOP

A simple E-shop as part of E-rply Front-End Challenge using Vue.JS

- [See it live!](https://erply-frontend-shop.firebaseapp.com/#/)

This project is built with [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) and [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex).

Also I suggest you to use [vue-devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) if you want a see how everything happens.

## How it works
###  Home page:
- Shop has homepage where the products are listed
- Products can be filtered by Store (country) and Availability (stock)
###  Product page:
- When you click on a product, it should go to product details
- The is should be shown with currency
- Users is  able to add/remove products to/from their cart
###  Cart page:
- Shopping Cart page (adding products, removing products, totals and          checkout )
## Build Setup

```
# cd vue-shop

# npm install

# npm start

# run all tests
npm test
```
